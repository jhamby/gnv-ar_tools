GNV is an open source, GNU and other package based, Unix environment for
OpenVMS. It is intended to provide the important subset of Unix/Linux/POSIX
necessary to port UNIX software to VMS. GNV consists of many parts, including
a Unix like shell environment and utilities which provides functions typically
found on Unix systems, but are missing, incomplete, or incorrect on VMS.
