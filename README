This is a repository for the ar_tools package that is a component of the
GNV project for VMS.

Its purpose is to provide a record of the source used for the GNV packaged
version of the product.

For GNV components that are friendly forks of an open source project, the
reference/ directory will provide a copy of the unmodified upstream source
used for building the package.

For GNV components that have the VMS support totally integrated with the
upstream, then the repository here will be empty.

As the ar_tools project is a VMS specific project, the source will be in the
reference/ directory, and the vms_source/ directory is empty.

A VMS concealed logical name of src_root: is for the reference directory and
a VMS concealed logical name of vms_root: is set ot the vms_source directory.

These are kept separate to make it easy to determine what VMS specific changes
where made and to allow retargeting the src_root: to a different version to
easily support maintaining multiple versions such as release, beta, and trunk
at the same time.

The user can then create a logical name of lcl_root: for the directory that
will contain the build products.  The lcl_root: directory tree is the only
directory tree that the build procedure should be modifying.

A logcal name search list of prj_root: is set to lcl_root:,vms_root:,src_root:
for building the package.

Mercurial was chosen for the repository as there are clients that can run on
VMS that is native to it.
